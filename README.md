# Project 7 - WordPress Pentesting

> Objective: Discover and demonstrate proofs-of-concepts for at least three and (up to five) exploits affecting an older version of WordPress.

    - [Blog Post Documenting Vulnerability](https://perishablepress.com/stop-user-enumeration-wordpress/)
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough:

  - [ ] Steps to recreate:
    We try to access all the users in the db using a simple http get request by changing the values of the "author" parameter
    1. Enter ```http://wpdistillery.com?author=<author id>``` in the URL field and insert a number, which will be treated like an id.
      I used 1 as the first test param because usually 1 is assigned to the admin ```http://wpdistillery.com?author=1```
    2. We will be redirected to ```http://wpdistillery.vm/author/<user id>/ ```
      In my test case, I was redirected to ```http://wpdistillery.vm/author/admin/``` hence proving that we can access any user by brute forcing the author parameter. We can do this with burp or with a simple python script.
